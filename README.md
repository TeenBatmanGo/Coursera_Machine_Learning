# Coursera_Machine_Learning

## Repo Description

- Python implementations of eight exercises from ML course on Coursera
- Three extra python notebooks.

I started taking this course as a green hand in both Python and Machine Learning.
This repo serves as historical records of my learning process. **So I don't recommend others
forking it.**
